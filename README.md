## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project showcases a Power BI dashboard built to analyse employee attrition trends across departments, roles, education levels, and demographics. The dashboard provides HR stakeholders with a clear view of where and why employee turnover is occurring.

The dataset was pre-cleaned and structured, allowing the focus to remain on building dynamic, interactive visuals using relationships and slicers in Power BI.

HR leadership needs visibility into:
- Which departments and job roles have the highest attrition
- Which salary bands and education levels see the most turnover
- How attrition varies by age, gender, and years at the company
